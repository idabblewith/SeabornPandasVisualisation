# Info

Day 78 of the 100 Day Python Bootcamp regarding data science and Nobel Prizes.
This project demonstrates ETL by importing an unsanitised set of data from a CSV file, cleaning that data, and the plotting it with Pandas, Scipy, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Plotly.

Please note that most sections of the code have been commented out. By default a sunburst chart is shown when the program is run (Line 325).
You will need to uncomment the section you wish to visualise in a chart, and optionally comment out the previous section to prevent charts appearing after each other.


## Dependencies

- All dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file.
     
## Project Steps

3. Review the visualised clean data.
4. To visualise different data, comment the current chart and uncomment the chart you would like to see.
